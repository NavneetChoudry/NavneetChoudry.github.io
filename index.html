				 Welcome to my website. I am an electronics hobbyist, digital content creator, and an all-time computer science student. In the past few years I have worked on many independent projects alongside my formal education. I have knowledge in Java and Cpp, Python as well as building this website using responsive web technologies. Additionally, I am a chess player. I created this site to share my interests, as they evolve, and connect with like minded individuals.I spend a lot of time building software and electronics, but thereâ€™s also a lot more to it.
